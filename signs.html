<h1>Jack's Animated Signs Info</h1>
<p>Contact me on discord (JackJack33#6425) if you need to report a bug <br>or need help with anything else regarding this script.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can <a href="https://discord.gg/RJU5qWn28q">join the Cosmos Discord</a>, which is a server <br>run by myself, fjsu, and Santio71. However please do not send them DM's regarding <br>
this script, it is not their responsibility :)!</p>
  
<h2>Setting Up an Animated Sign</h3>
<p>Simply place a sign that contains <code>[jas]</code> in the top line, then exit the sign editor. <br>This will result in the sign on the right. You can right-click this sign to view info about it. <br>You can also delete the sign through this action.</p>

<p>In order to give the sign an animation, simply look at the sign run the command <code>/jas.settype</code> <br>and select a type from the GUI. Note that in order to do this you must either be the<br>owner of the sign, or be an operator. <br>Clicking the item will close the GUI and start the animation.</p>

<p>For some animations, the playback rate might be too slow or too fast. In order to change this, look at the sign and run <code>/jas.setrate (integer)</code>.<br>This will set the playback rate in ticks per frame (tpf) to the selected integer (between 1 and 20 inclusive only!).

<p>Another common feature of animations is the custom color field, notated by <code>\a(integer)</code> (ex: <code>\a1 \a5 \a12</code>)<br>You can change the applied color of this field using the command <code>/jas.setcol (integer) (hex)</code> while looking at the sign.<br>Note that some signs might look weird if you do not apply custom colors to needed fields. Below is<br>an example of a broken sign and a working sign.</p>

<p>Both the tpf and custom colors are specific to one sign, and must be reapplied to other signs in order to<br>achieve the same effect. <b>Running the command on one sign will not change another</b>.</p>
  
<h2>Creating Custom Animations</h2>
  
<p>Animations are stored globally, and each can be used by any online players with permission to modify signs.<br> The script will come with 3 animations by default, but it is super easy to create your own!</p>

<h3>Abbreviations</h3>
<p>Firstly, you should probably familiarize yourself with the different abbreviations used and stored in signs that are custom set in this script.<p>
<ul>
  <li><code>\s</code> - 1 Space</li>
  <li><code>\t</code> - 3 Spaces</li>
  <li><code>\n</code> - Next line</li>
  <li><code>\c</code> - Abbreviates <code>ยง</code> or <code>&</code>, followed by a color code (0-9, a-f).</li>
  <li><code>\a</code> - Abbreviates a custom color (see above)</li>
</ul>

<p>These abbreviations are used in conjunction with the actual text on the sign to form a<br>single string, or line of text, that represents the sign. You can test what this text will<br>look like by running <code>/jas.tostring</code> while looking at any sign.<p>
  
<h3>Creating Frames</h3>
<p>Next what you will want to do is create each frame of your desired animation. You can do this several different ways,<br>but I prefer to create a line of signs so I can see what going from one frame to the next might look like.</p>
