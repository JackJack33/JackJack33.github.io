<h2>Setting Up an Animated Sign</h3>
<p>Simply place a sign that contains <code>[jas]</code> in the top line, then exit the sign editor. <br>This will result in the sign on the right. You can right-click this sign to view info about it. <br>You can also delete the sign through this action.</p>

<p>In order to give the sign an animation, simply look at the sign run the command <code>/jas.settype</code> <br>and select a type from the GUI. Note that in order to do this you must either be the<br>owner of the sign, or be an operator. <br>Clicking the item will close the GUI and start the animation.</p>

<p>For some animations, the playback rate might be too slow or too fast. In order to change this, look at the sign and run <code>/jas.setrate (integer)</code>.<br>This will set the playback rate in ticks per frame (tpf) to the selected integer (between 1 and 20 inclusive only!).

<p>Another common feature of animations is the custom color field, notated by <code>\a(integer)</code> (ex: <code>\a1 \a5 \a12</code>)<br>You can change the applied color of this field using the command <code>/jas.setcol (integer) (hex)</code> while looking at the sign.<br>Note that some signs might look weird if you do not apply custom colors to needed fields. Below is<br>an example of a broken sign and a working sign.</p>

<p>Both the tpf and custom colors are specific to one sign, and must be reapplied to other signs in order to<br>achieve the same effect. <b>Running the command on one sign will not change another</b>.</p>
