<h3>Here's how to set up an animated sign.</h3>
<p>Simply place a sign that contains [jas] in the top line, then exit the sign editor. <br>This will result in the sign on the right. You can right-click this sign to view info about it. <br>You can also delete the sign through this action.</p>

<p>In order to give the sign an animation, simply look at the sign run the command <code>/jas.settype</code> <br>and select a type from the GUI. Note that in order to do this you must either be the<br>owner of the sign, or be an operator.
