<h2>Setting up Launch Pads</h2>
<p>Launch pads are super simple. Pick a material (planks, iron, or gold), and place a block down<br>with a pressure plate of the same material on top. Then, use redstone to power the block below the material block.</p>

<h2>Configuring Launch Pads</h2>
<p>Additionally, it's easy to modify the force values applied when you use a launch pad.<br>Simply run the command <code>/jlp.view</code> to view the current values, and use <code>/jlp.set (wood|iron|gold) (up|forward) (number)</code><br>to apply a new value. (Decimal and negative numbers are supported)<p>

<p>Note that these commands both require op to be run</p>
